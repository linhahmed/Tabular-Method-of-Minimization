# Tabular-Method-of-Minimization
* The tabular method which is also known as the Quine-McCluskey method is particularly useful when minimising functions having a large number of variables e.g. The six-variable functions. 
Computer programs have been developed employing this algorithm.
* The method reduces a function in standard sum of products form to a set of prime implicants from which as many variables are eliminated as possible. 
* These prime implicants are then examined to see if some are redundant.
